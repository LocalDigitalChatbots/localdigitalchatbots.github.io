# Full discovery application for the Local Digital Fund

## Project title: Can chatbots and AI help solve service design problems?

### Lead applicant:Oxford City Council

Neil Lawrence, Digital Development Manager (nlawrence@oxford.gov.uk)

### Partner organisations involved

* Hertsmere District Council
* Cheltenham Borough Council
* Doncaster Council
* Preston City Council
* North East Derbyshire District Council
* Bolsover District Council
* Calderdale Council
* Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council
* Bromsgrove District Council
* Redditch Borough Council
* Surrey County Council

## Question 1: Summary of proposal for the common problem you want to solve*

_What is the problem you are seeking to address in the discovery phase, and what are your main objectives for this project? \[max 1500 characters\]_

There is a drive amongst local authorities to embrace the potential opportunities provided by AI and chatbots as a means to improve service to their customers, solve complex issues in service delivery and release efficiencies through reduced staff resource requirements.

However, there are problems for local authorities looking to adopt these solutions;

* There is no shared understanding of the technology and its advantages/disadvantages as a solution to key issues. For example, what type of application is it best suited to in order to ensure the best return on investment
* There are a variety of products and platforms that already exist on the market, but no objective evaluation of each to identify the most appropriate to use.
* There is a risk of duplicating effort, wasting time and resource in the discovery phase to arrive at the same conclusions that others have already reached
* Without a sound evidence base, there is a risk of inappropriate chatbot/AI projects being pursued that have poor prospects of meeting their objectives, wasting further time and resource

This discovery project aims to resolve these problems by delivering;

* a methodology for evaluating the suitability or otherwise of a particular application for developing into a chatbot or AI product
* a research base to assist local authorities developing their individual business cases to save time and resource rather than duplicating research
* a summary of the potential technology solutions that are available with their individual advantages and disadvantages of each, and their applicability to different circumstances
* a set of case studies drawn from participating councils in how the framework can be applied

In pursuing this it will also;

* explore the feasibility of adopting or developing a common, open source platform for local government to use to develop chatbot/AI solutions
* for the participating councils, deliver a set of recommendations on how to proceed with their use cases to alpha stage
* Enable (an) alpha project(s) to take over from the discovery phase for the case studies, either funded collectively by participating authorities or through the MCHLG Local Digital Fund.

## Question 2: How you will approach the problem*

_Tell us how you plan to deliver this project, mentioning:_

* _essential events or milestones_
* _whether you’ll do everything in-house or appoint an external company to lead the project_
* _how you’ll measure whether your objectives have been met_
* _how you’ll deliver polished, publishable outputs - including those listed in the prospectus as required - by the end of March 2019_

_\[max 2000 characters\]_

As a collection of councils we have differing levels of experience of working using Agile techniques, and none have knowledge of using chatbots or AI for solving service issues.

We will use the Digital Marketplace Outcomes and Specialists framework to find a digital agency partner with suitable knowledge and experience to help guide the project, ensure a consistency of approach across the partner councils, guide the user research and undertake background research.

Specifically, the successful agency will;

* Work with partner councils in setting expectations and principles for the project as a whole
* Instruct the partner councils in how to approach their user research (data to collect, methods to use, ways to capture and share findings)
* explore the feasibility of adopting or developing a common, open source platform for local government to use to develop chatbot/AI solutions
* Compile the user research and publishing the findings
* Develop and publish a business case for analysing the findings
* Producing a summary report and recommendations

Managing delivery timescales

There are 81 working days (from announcement to delivery date) for the project to run, so an effective work plan is essential. This will be managed by the lead authority (Oxford City Council)

We will begin preparing our Digital Marketplace requirements shortly after submission of this application to ensure the procurement can start immediately after.

The procurement will consume up to 4 weeks of the available time, during which time other non-dependent activities can be scheduled. This will include recruiting user research participants and reserving

The scope of the project has been scaled to address the time available (8 weeks), for instance by limiting the service user research to four areas. This will allow for up to three councils to collaborate on each area to get a wider spread of user research and identify benefits wider than a single authority.

Using a ‘publish as we progress’ approach will mean that deliverables will be created during the course of the project as well as at its conclusion. Time will be set aside in the project plan to ensure this takes place.

The project milestones will be;

A full project plan has been developed in Smartsheet for tracking through the project delivery stage and is available at

[https://publish.smartsheet.com/3286f190f6a8413d8678c35f75c0a105](https://publish.smartsheet.com/3286f190f6a8413d8678c35f75c0a105 "https://publish.smartsheet.com/3286f190f6a8413d8678c35f75c0a105")

## Question 3: Benefits to the local government sector*

_Describe the current cost of the problem you’re looking to address, and highlight the benefits that could be achieved for local people and public service providers if your project is successful (e.g. avoid staff re-keying a lot of data or applicants waiting too long to receive a service)._

_\[max 2000 characters\]_

Chatbots and AI are being considered by councils across a broad range of service areas but work on these is not shared, with any user research not visible, the business cases not shared and the outcomes not published. For councils wishing to start work in this area they, effectively, have to start from scratch, replicating work already undertaken. This can’t be easily quantified but the shared outputs of this project will help minimise them and reduce cost

The chosen areas for research and their key service enquiries are;

* Do I need planning permission? (lead: Oxford City Council)
* Getting information and signposting residents on highways enquiries and reporting (lead: Surrey County Council)
* Getting information on licensing \[something\] (lead: Cheltenham Borough Council)
* Getting information on waste and recycling queries (lead: Doncaster Council)
* Dealing with queries on Revenues and Benefits (lead: Bromsgrove and Redditch Councils)

The potential benefits for each of these areas is set out below

### Planning advice

In 2017/18 Oxford City Council received 2,154 planning applications online and 3,929 planning application comments online, so the propensity for using online services for planning is high.

Currently the planning service funds a planning advice drop-in service for the public for 3 hours each day (equivalent to 105 person days per year) using a qualified planning officer. Estimated costs for this are 0.41FTE (or £15,400 per annum) which could be released. Service could be extended beyond the current delivery hours using an alternative delivery method.

The current guidance available to the public via the Planning Portal ([https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200234/home_improvement_projects](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200234/home_improvement_projects "https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200234/home_improvement_projects")) is lengthy, confusion and includes an interactive diagram that fails to adequately answer simple questions. Using a common chatbot, or set of chatbots here, could improve this service and deliver benefits much wider than the councils involved in this application

### Highways Defect reporting and enquiries

72,000 visitors on average per year visit Surrey County Council Highways web pages to report defects. Between January 2018 and November 2018 there has been an increase in Highways demand with this figure already up to 82,000. One of the challenges for engagement with citizens through digital channels is drop off rates. For example from the first page to the confirmation page only 21% of visitors complete reporting a defect. Our data shows that 5.3% of the visitors exit the journey by clicking to the “contact us” page. Assuming that these visitors are calling the contact centre to report those defects, this equates to 4,350 avoidable calls per year. This is reflected as 0.5 FTE additional costs to the contact centre which could potentially be released. Moreover, quality and availability of service to our residents can be improved if digital assistant chatbots could help our residents to find out the right information in the first place and guide them through the process 24x7 – improving citizen experience and make savings.

In addition to Highways defect reporting, 62% of the visitors who drop off from the Roads and Transport landing page are also potential opportunities for avoidable calls to our contact centre.  These general highways enquiries to our 1st line contact centre can readily be responded by chatbots and there is also an opportunity that we can investigate in this discovery work. This opportunity could be extended to more specialist 2nd line service contacts in the future, meaning more savings throughout the value chain by reducing the time spent on responding to enquiries.

### Waste and recycling enquiries

Doncaster Council currently receives about 95,000 waste enquiry phone calls per annum which makes up a third of all phone contact despite a good online offer regularly promoted. This is equivalent to about 8 Customer Service Advisors at a cost of approximately 191k per annum during the working hours 8.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday. Therefore, the use of chatbots could contribute to the release of resource but also extend this to a 24/7 service.

### Revenues and Benefits

There are a number of strands where we could use chatbots in the Redditch Borough Council and Bromsgrove District Council Revenues and Benefits Team (Shared Service) :

1\. Recovery of Council Tax and Sundry Debts

We issue approximately 50,000 recovery notices per year across the authorities.  These notices drive extensive demand into the council with call volumes increasing three fold in the days following issue.

A majority of recovery notices can be resolved through the application if business rules which will require limited interface between the customer and back office systems and then dependant on levels of debt, recovery history and payment methods, the call can be resolved through a simple payment arrangement of recovery inhibit.

The use of AI and chatbots can remove these simple calls from the process and allow complex cases to be passed quickly for evaluation by trained officers.

The issuing of recovery notices requires a minimum of 5 FTE to be available for fielding customer enquiries (approx. £125,000 pa).

2\. Progress of benefit application and notification of change in circumstances.

The calls received into The HB services will be in relation to chasing claims, and proviso of information in relation to change in circumstances.

These calls require simple interrogation of back office systems to provide update on claim process and information to the customer on the actions that they need to take to progress claims.  The equivalent of 1 FTE (approx. £25,000 pa) is utilised solely to field these enquiries.

We also have a fifth service area for research should time and capacity allow;

### Licencing

The licensing team in Cheltenham Borough Council are currently undergoing a digital transformation, to improve service efficiency and customer experience.  Following the introduction of online forms, it would be beneficial to explore whether AI and chatbots could support full automation of certain elements of the licencing process, reduce the time spent on standard enquiries and improve the customer experience. Although no baseline data exists to understand how much time the licencing team spend on enquiries, if we were able to reduce time spent handling the validation of the existing 4000 licences, by half an hour, there is the potential to save approximately 2000 hours with an estimated value of  £30,000.  Prior to starting the research project data would be collected to confirm the current number of enquiries, in order to identify how this new technology would impact the frequency the licencing team answer emails and phone calls.  An online survey would be included within the research to inform our understanding our customer’s response to the technology.

Other benefits will be delivered through the capability building as part of the work, with less reliance placed on suppliers to undertake user research . Train up person to be able to conduct in future

## Question 4: Demonstrate how you’ll ensure your work is relevant to others*

_Describe how you propose to collaborate with other councils in the development and delivery of shareable user research, benefits research and proposals to develop solutions in this phase of work._

_\[max 1000 characters\]_

The interest and involvement shown by the partner councils involved in this application also reflects the current issue that many smaller councils find themselves in: “how do we get started if we wish to use chatbots as a solution to a service issue?” The project will seek to address this with practical examples.

The large number of partner councils and their distribution across the country will make collaboration on project delivery more challenging.

We will use collaborative tools as we have to develop this application; using Google Docs for creating and sharing information, and Google Hangouts for our meetings.

We will create and update a blog throughout the project with each participating council posting their progress during discovery. A lightweight project website using GitHub will be set up early on to facilitate this, with access for publishing via a CMS interface

We will adopt an ‘open first’ approach to how we work, including any mistakes, to help others learn from our experience.

The outputs from the project will be published on our project website in a format that can ensure their re-use by others for their own discovery of alpha phases.

## Q5 Impacts expected from funding*

Describe the outputs you expect to produce, making sure to mention the 3 required project outputs. Explain how you’ll ensure they’re ready to share online by the last week of the project.

_You must mention:_

* _a business case or benefits case that explains the cost of the problem and the potential for savings - both to the councils involved and the nation_
* _a user research report, justifying the project’s conclusions_
* _a conclusion proposing what product or service you should develop in an ‘alpha’ project to sole the problem(s) you’ve identified in your research. This may include a first draft ‘to be’ user journey map. If the problem turned out to be different from or more complex than imagined, the conclusion should outline the need for more work in a new discovery project, or a recommendation that this work will not continue._

_\[max 2000 characters\]_

By 29 March 2019 the project will have delivered;

### Research methodology

We will use our digital agency to design an approach to information discovery for the participating councils to use in assessing chatbots/AI to deliver solutions for particular applications.

This will be captured in a series of templates that can be published and re-used by others. This will be an early deliverable of the project to guide the initial research work.

### Business case

We will commission our digital agency to develop a framework for evaluating the suitability or otherwise of a particular application for developing into a chatbot or AI product. This will be in a format that other councils can download and complete with their own data

This framework will be used to examine the feasibility of the four service area cases, comparing old and new scenarios to arrive at a value for money evaluation for adopting the technology as a service design improvement.

### Technology summary

Will will commission our digital agency to develop an overview of the potential technology solutions that are currently available with their individual advantages and disadvantages, and their applicability to different circumstances.

This will be in a form that can be updated and maintained by others to ensure the summary stays valid and useful to the sector. The work will be completed prior to the summary report so it can be used in the recommendations for next steps

### Feasibility report

Following on from the technology summary, our digital agency will also examine the feasibility of developing a common platform for localgov to adopt, and which technology to pursue. This will be published as a report that will be used for the final recommendations in moving to an alpha phase.

### User research reports

We will publish all outputs on our website on our user research from the four service areas, and will produce a final summary report in a format ready to be published on localdigital.gov.uk. The user research teams will make use of existing templates to present user research findings in a consistent way after every round of user research.

### Summary report and recommendations

Our digital agency will produce a final report that either proposes how to take the individual projects forward to alpha stage or explains why each should not continue.

We have the last week of March reserved for this work to ensure that the deadline is met.

### Case studies (use cases)

The outputs from our user research and business case analysis will be developed into four case studies to assist local authorities developing their individual business cases to save time and resource rather than duplicating research.

This will be developed in parallel to the summary report by each of the four service area leads in the last week of the project.

## Question 6: User research and engagement*

_Who are your users, how will you engage with them in the discovery phase and what are the proposed user research objectives?_

_\[max 2000 characters\]_

User research will be used to;

* Understand the current user experience in each of the service areas chosen
* Understand the costs of current service delivery
* Identify issues and opportunities for service design improvement
* Identify why users choose the current channels that they do
* Identify shortfalls in the user experience; frustrations that they face
* Understand the attitudes towards using webchat/chatbots as a contact channel

For each of the four services chosen, the research will;

* Pool existing data on the area (volumes of contact, methods of contact, existing feedback, current costs/staffing)
* Identify the user groups to involve and recruit participants
* Map the current user journey with users
* Use interviews with users, including any current use of webchat services
* Record findings in a common format

The users for each area will be;

* Customers/residents that interact with services to obtain information or resolution
* Front line staff that interact with customers/residents to assist them
* Business customers or agents that act on behalf of customers/residents as a proxy

Users will be recruited to the research process through;

* invitation of existing users that use the service, recruited at the point of contact
* seeking out the most relevant staff in council front line services
* for known (regular) business users or agents, inviting them directly via email

The appointed digital agency will plan, direct and (where feasible) undertake the user research. They will also complete the summary of findings.
