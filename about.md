A short introduction by project lead, Neil Lawrence of Oxford City Council

## "Starting from scratch"

When we first starting discussing this project as a group of councils we had a common problem; we wanted to explore the opportunities that chatbots and AI could offer us and our customers, but it was difficult knowing where to start.

There are multiple platforms available, and countless suppliers that are offering services to build apps. Which is the right one to choose?

## Reinventing the wheel

The temptation with new tech is to dive straight in and start doing something. Find a platform, spend some money, build something and see how it is received. But we realised this would be history repeating itself. Local Government has often approached adopting digital tools through individualism; everyone adopts their own version of the best solution, and the sector gets fragmented by reinventing the wheel over and over.

## Changing the approach

There have been some great initiatives to help bring the sector together;

* LocalGov Digital developed the local government version of the Digital Service Standard to unify the sector's approach to developing services
* Government as a Platform is providing common tools that the public sector can use to build great digital services
* LocalGov Digital is using Pipeline to promote projects and collaboration on them

We wanted to use this project as a way to influence how the sector moves forward on chatbots and AI by providing a set of research and tools to help inform everyone that is 'starting from scratch'

## Commitment to sharing

We'll commit to making this a project that all of local government can use by;

* blogging about the work we undertake, the lessons we learn and the mistakes we make
* engaging with a digital agency that commits to sharing its work
* publish the outputs of the user research we undertake
* provide a business case template for others to use
* provide a summary of current tech in this area as an overview for others to use
