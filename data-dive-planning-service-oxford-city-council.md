An analysis of the data produced to inform the project business case

## Telephone calls

## Face to face visits

Data range: 01/02/2018 to 21/02/2019 

Customer Service Advisers saw 768 customers as “Fast-Track” appointments and the Planning Duty office saw 832 customers as appointments. The “Fast-Tracks” are essentially customers dealt with at reception who do not require appointments.

Customers are able to pre-book appointments by phone to see a customer service adviser about a range of council services, but for planning customers they are told about the drop-in service operating hours and have to present themselves for an appointment on the day.

Data on visits was collected on ZMan for logging these and have very few options for data scrutiny. They are almost always logged as “anon”. We also know that we do not track 100% of our visitors in ZMan, so these numbers may represent 40%-70% of our true workload."
