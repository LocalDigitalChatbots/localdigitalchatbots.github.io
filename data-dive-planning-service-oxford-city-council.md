An analysis of the data produced to inform the project business case

## Telephone calls

The Contact Centre has a 40-seat capacity and handles the majority of calls from the public across a range of services, including Planning.

Planning is considered as a small service within the Contact Centre and so has no dedicated officers taking calls. Callers are routed using IVR to an available Customer Service Adviser, acting as a ‘triage’ for calls to the planning department. It does not have trained planners working within it.

A large proportion of calls received are for a named individual, but local policy is to not give out their direct phone numbers.

### Annual calls

Data range: 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018

* Total calls received: 209,474

Data range: 1 April 2018 to 31 January 2019

* Total calls received: 180,732

## Face to face visits

Data range: 01/02/2018 to 21/02/2019

Face to face volumes are [published online](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/performance/transactions.html)

Customers are able to pre-book appointments by phone to see a customer service adviser about a range of council services, but for planning customers they are told about the Planning drop-in service operating hours and have to present themselves for an appointment on the day.

The drop-in service operates 3 hrs per day using 20 minutes interview slots (10:00am to 1:00pm, with the last appointment at 12:40pm). It provides [limited professional advice](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20066/planning_applications/723/contacting_us_for_planning_advice) but this does not include if planning permission is required, for which a separate [pre-application process](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20066/planning_applications/331/pre-application_planning_advice) is available.

Customer Service Advisers saw 768 customers as “Fast-Track” appointments and the Planning Duty officer saw 832 customers as appointments.

* 13.8% of mails are internal (colleagues and distribution lists)

### Web contact form emails
