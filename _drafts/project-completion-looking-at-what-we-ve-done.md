At the start of this process we submitted an application for a discovery project that aimed to deliver

* a methodology for evaluating the suitability or otherwise of a particular application for developing into a chatbot or AI product
* a research base to assist local authorities developing their individual business cases to save time and resource rather than duplicating research
* a summary of the potential technology solutions that are available with their individual advantages and disadvantages of each
* a set of case studies drawn from participating councils

We've now reached the conclusion of this project, but have a wealth of materials aimed specifically at local government to re-use for work in this area;

* If you're unclear how to get started on user research we have a sample interview script as well as a template user experience map 
* If you need a broad overview of customer experience in four distinct service areas we have completed customer experience maps as well as case studies for each
