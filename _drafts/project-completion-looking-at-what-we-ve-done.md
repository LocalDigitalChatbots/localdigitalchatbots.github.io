At the start of this process we submitted an application for a discovery project that aimed to deliver;

* a methodology for evaluating the suitability or otherwise of a particular application for developing into a chatbot or AI product
* a research base to assist local authorities developing their individual business cases to save time and resource rather than duplicating research
* a summary of the potential technology solutions that are available with their individual advantages and disadvantages of each
* a set of case studies drawn from participating councils

We've now reached the end of the project, and all these deliverables are now available below or via our [project resources page](https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/project-resources/)

But this project has been more than just producing a set of reports;

* In Oxford, we've used the Digital Outcomes and Specialists Framework for procuring a digital agency for the first time
* We've trained a batch of staff in councils about the basics of user research and how to present their findings as user experience maps
* We've had councils undertake user research interviews for the first time, and given them a set of tools to become more self-sufficient in this area
* We've worked collaboratively to support each other and share the outcomes of our research with each other
* We've worked in the open and made all our materials available for anyone else in the sector to use

## What we have learned

Intro

* Collaboration is difficult to do, but pays dividends if you get it right; it involves _how_ you work together as much as _what_ you are working on together
* Perceptions of users' views need to be tested and challenged to see if they are valid. Rushing to a technological solution without considering this risks failure
* Any conversation with a council is nearly always part of a longer journey. As a result, when considering chatbots, it is vital to model requirements in terms of user journeys, rather than simply in terms of technical specifications.
* A service that exhibits a high number of complex enquiries (for example, by being emotional theme, complex subject area, a topic prone to

  subjectivity, or a matter of contention or debate) is not considered good

  territory for a chatbot. These complex, human-drive enquiries are better handled by a human.
