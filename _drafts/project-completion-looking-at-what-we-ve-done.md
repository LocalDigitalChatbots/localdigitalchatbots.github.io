At the start of this process we submitted an application for a discovery project that aimed to deliver;

* a methodology for evaluating the suitability or otherwise of a particular application for developing into a chatbot or AI product
* a research base to assist local authorities developing their individual business cases to save time and resource rather than duplicating research
* a summary of the potential technology solutions that are available with their individual advantages and disadvantages of each 
* a set of case studies drawn from participating councils

We've now reached the end of the project, and all these deliverables are now available below or via our [project resources page](https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/project-resources/)

But this project has been more than just producing a set of reports;

* In Oxford, we've used the Digital Outcomes and Specialists Framework for procuring a digital agency for the first time
* We've trained a batch of staff in the participating councils in the basics of user research and how to present their findings as user experience maps
* We've had the councils undertake user research interviews for the first time, and given them a set of tools to become more self-sufficient in this area
* We've worked collaboratively to support each other and share the outcomes of our research
* We've worked in the open and made all our materials available for anyone else in the sector to use

## What we have learned

The following points are distilled from the main project reports, which provide far greater detail than can be provided in summary form;

### Collaboration

* Collaboration is difficult to do, but pays dividends if you get it right; it involves _how_ you work together as much as _what_ you are working on together
* Working collaboratively on discovery allows you to pool a wider sample of user research participants and gain insight into any regional variations

### User research

* Any conversation with a council is nearly always part of a longer journey. As a result, when considering chatbots, it is vital to model requirements in terms of user journeys, rather than simply in terms of technical specifications.
* A service that exhibits a high number of complex enquiries (for example, by being emotional theme, complex subject area, a topic prone to

  subjectivity, or a matter of contention or debate) is not considered good

  territory for a chatbot. These complex, human-drive enquiries are better handled by a person
* Users value a conversation 
* There are simple things we can do to improve the user journey before using chatbots, such as web content improvement, better search optimisation and easier links to getting more help

### Recommended option from research

* Of the four services we explored in depth (Planning, Waste & Recycling, Revenues & Benefits, Highways) the most likely option for an alpha project to take the research forward was Waste & Recycling. This was  because;
  * it deals with a high level of simple information or service requests that have a high rate of first line resolution
  * these fall into relatively few distinct reasons for calling (80% of calls can be categorised into three specific reasons for contact) which means a chatbot can address a large proportion of calls
  * it involves a largely non-emotional user journey and an expressed user need for self-service 
* If 20 councils collaborated on a chatbot in this area, estimated savings across all 20 councils would be Â£2.2m
* The amount saved per council is nearly four times as much as it would be if councils developed their own chatbot in isolation

### Technology approach

* All the major cloud and open source providers have adopted a very similar set of technologies for their conversational AI platforms, meaning they can all be trained from a very similar data model.
* The primary challenge in developing a shared chatbot platform for local government  is not a technical one, it is an organisational one. Councils must agree to co-operate and then collaborate in building an overall model for a research area that can adapt to the variety of ways of handling the chosen area, as well as adapt to the variety of terms used across England for that area
* Whilst an entirely open-source version of a centralised platform is attractive, it may not be the cheaper option, since the cost to establish this system at scale for multiple councils would be significant. Utilising an existing cloud-based proprietary platform built for this sort of scenario could be cheaper and provide a higher quality solution.
* The software costs-per-serve are generally a small portion of the overall cost. The costs of developing the initial model, the investment in ongoing maintenance and training, and integrations to a wide variety of differing back-end systems across each council, are likely to represent the greatest portion of project cost.
* We must carefully select use-cases where the information and backend infrastructure sending to and receiving data from the conversational AI system are sufficient to create a satisfactory outcome for the user. For these reasons, use-case selection and user research is extremely important in creating a data model for the system to use.
* Although differences in features between the best platforms are small, the overall recommendation from this project for a conversational AI platform would be;
  * IBM Watson Assistant Plus or Premium for a public cloud hosted system; or
  * Rasa Stack for an open source privately cloud hosted system
