This week we completed Sprint #2 of the project, looking at waste and recycling services across four councils. As well as user research interviews with 24 members of the public there were stakeholder interviews with 9 staff in councils.

## User research interviews

### North East Derbyshire

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted in North East Derbyshire.

Most users were looking for something or making a service request; all were simple interactions and on the whole users had a positive experience.

The majority of users defaulted to using a mobile phone - they didn't need a desktop (like when using planning services, which was more complex). Using a mobile was a quick and easy method, allowing access to the web or to call if needed.

Everyone had a difficult web experience on council website

Some had to go back to google for search, or just called

Everyone said they preferred to self serve, but wouldn't hesitate to pick up phone if they got stuck/delayed

Are all paying customers, but can't switch as stuck with council. Don't see that they have the rights to complain as much - felt bad for complaining. If issue isn't resolved, have to adopt inconvenient solutions (waste to office or trips  the tip)

Experience Map

All started with triggered need - could be non-urgent or something that could be put off, or you start angry due to loss of bin.

Then into online search, find council website. People are confused which council - have to check the logo on the website to be sure. Confused not finding info on the site then contact the council

If resolved easy then great. If not then lots of waste and impacts significantly.

Simple journey and lots of opportunity to improve and self self
