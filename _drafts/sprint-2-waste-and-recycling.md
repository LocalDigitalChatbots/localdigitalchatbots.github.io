This week we completed Sprint #2 of the project, looking at waste and recycling services across four councils. As well as user research interviews with 24 members of the public there were stakeholder interviews with 9 staff in councils.

## User research interviews

### North East Derbyshire

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted in North East Derbyshire.

Most users were looking for something or making a service request; all were simple interactions and on the whole users had a positive experience.

The majority of users defaulted to using a mobile phone - they didn't need a desktop (like when using planning services, which was more complex). Using a mobile was a quick and easy method, allowing access to the web or to call if needed.

Everyone had a difficult experience on council website, with some having to go back to google to search for what they wanted, or just give up and make a call to the council.

Users are confused as to which council deals with their waste - some had to check the logo on the website to be sure.

Everyone said they preferred to self serve, but they wouldn't hesitate to pick up the phone to call if they got stuck or were delayed by the process.

Users don't necessarily see that they have the rights to complain as much, and felt bad for complaining if they did. If an issue isn't resolved, they often had to adopt inconvenient solutions, like taking waste to the office or trips to the waste tip.

So many people mentioned that they had no clue when services would be delivered, and are used to the 'Amazon experience' of getting SMS and email updates. Introducing functionality like this would reassure people and improve the user experience.

The user journey maps were walked through to illustrate the issues. These were simple journeys that showed lots of opportunity to improve and offer more self serve options.

## Stakeholder interviews

Tom Williams from Torchbox had been speaking to key stakeholders in each council, as well as using data gathered to date on contact centre activity and website analytics, to get an early view on opportunities to introduce automation in Waste and Recycling services.

The available data shared was really strong for this sprint and had led to good observations. There were lots of similarities across councils.

The data suggested large amount of calls can be handled without the need for back office handling, which bodes well for automation and suitability for chatbots.

Waste and recycling represents 14.5% of contact centre across 4 councils and so presents bigger potential saving from inbound calls. For Doncaster alone the potential saving was £180k, with a total saving of £1across the four councils.

Users want to self serve. Bit of difference as to how much is self serve. 

Some can't query missed bin on website

Extent to which real-time data is available. Data on collection teams - log contaminated waste against property - makes available to back office. Some real time, some when returns to depot at 4pm. Real time is powerful in helping self serve

Pre-empting customer needs. Often following up on previous interactions (5 days to deliver bin; alert them if there would be a delay). Also relevant for a change of service

Use cases for chatbots

3 types of enquiry; broad categorisation

Doncaster analysis - 99% are within 'sweet spot' for chat bot. Contrast with less than 40% for planning

Cross channel; even split between three, but cost of provision is hugely different. Good quality data provided
