This week we completed Sprint #2 of the project, looking at waste and recycling services across four councils. As well as user research interviews with 24 members of the public there were stakeholder interviews with 9 staff in councils.

## User research interviews

### North East Derbyshire

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted in North East Derbyshire.

Most users were looking for something or making a service request; all were simple interactions and on the whole users had a positive experience.

The majority of users defaulted to using a mobile phone - they didn't need a desktop (like when using planning services, which was more complex). Using a mobile was a quick and easy method, allowing access to the web or to call if needed.

Everyone had a difficult experience on council website, with some having to go back to google to search for what they wanted, or just give up and make a call to the council.

Users are confused as to which council deals with their waste - some had to check the logo on the website to be sure.

Everyone said they preferred to self serve, but they wouldn't hesitate to pick up the phone to call if they got stuck or were delayed by the process.

Users don't necessarily see that they have the rights to complain as much, and felt bad for complaining if they did. If an issue isn't resolved, they often had to adopt inconvenient solutions, like taking waste to the office or trips to the waste tip.

So many people mentioned that they had no clue when services would be delivered, and are used to the 'Amazon experience' of getting SMS and email updates. Introducing functionality like this would reassure people and improve the user experience.

The user journey maps were walked through to illustrate the issues. These were simple journeys that showed lots of opportunity to improve and offer more self serve options.

## Stakeholder interviews

Tom Williams from Torchbox had been speaking to key stakeholders in each council, as well as using data gathered to date on contact centre activity and website analytics, to get an early view on opportunities to introduce automation in Waste and Recycling services.

The available data shared was really strong for this sprint and had led to good observations. There were lots of similarities across councils.

The data suggested large amount of calls can be handled without the need for back office handling, which bodes well for automation and suitability for chatbots.

Waste and recycling represents 14.5% of contact centre across 4 councils and so presents bigger potential saving from inbound calls. For Doncaster alone the potential saving was £180k, with a total saving of £1across the four councils.

The Doncaster analysis shows 99% of calls are within the 'sweet spot' for chat bot services, being more transactional but still simple. This contrasts with less than 40% of calls meeting this criteria for planning services.

Users want to self serve, but there was a difference across councils as to how much this is possible. Some can't query missed bins on their websites. 

The availability of real time data, such as that for contaminated collections, is a key factor in helping self serve functionality.

Pre-empting customer needs would be another service enhancement by following up on previous interactions (e.g. if it takes 5 days to deliver a new bin, alert users if there is likely to be a delay). 

## Learning points

Luiza, Kyle and Kristen worked on a retrospective after the user research interviews in North East Derbyshire to identify things for others to take away from the process

### Things that made it good

* Kristen took care of us :coffee: :cookie: and helped with all the set up and bringing people to - from the interview room
* We spoke to 6 people - met our target :) 
* Water was provided - good for day long interviewing + to make interviewees comfortable
* Phone set up for remote interviews was all done for us - good connection!
* (Kristen) I got to listen in to Luiza and Kyle interviewing on day 1 and pick up some good tips. I think I would have felt quite lost to begin with, otherwise.

### Things that made it bad

* The out of town location meant we had to rely on transport - the taxi was late picking us up on day 2 
* (Kristen) Two users asked to change appointments at the last minute
* One user shook my hand on the way in, even though he was quite ill and coughing everywhere :expressionless: 
* User who brought her 2 year old kid with her was slightly distracted during the interview (kid trying to escape the room (we had to build a blockade), having to change nappies mid session, kid eating the Sudocrem) - we got as much value as possible from the session but it was challenging
* Not having lunch options on site / within walking distance 
* (Kristen) I found it difficult to keep to the timeslot with the first few people - it’s clearly a skill gained from experience to stop people from going off topic or ‘waffling’

## Next Steps

Next week is Sprint #3 looking at Revenues and Benefits services in Redditch, Bromsgrove,
