## User research interviews

### Redditch and Bromsgrove

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted

### Preston

Ian Heslop

### Cheltenham

Claire Cook ran a third week of interviews at Cheltenham.

## Stakeholder interviews

Tom Williams from Torchbox had been speaking to key stakeholders in each council, as well as using data gathered to date on contact centre activity and website analytics, to get an early view on opportunities to introduce automation in Revenues and Benefits services.

There were multiple touch points required in dealing with calls, with referrals both inside and outside the council. A key comment was that nearly every case dealt with was unique.

There is a limited ability to self serve for transactions like changes of circumstances and viewing council tax balances.

People expressed a preference for human contact risk for chatbot confusion is high

There were significant data challenges

\- at top level quite patchy

\- call centre there are dedicated phone number. No single council provided aggregated data across both(????)

\- Nearly all calls transferred to back office teams so many more conversations taking place than shown in the 

\- no data for drop-in or home visit services. This provision is common/expensive

\- No cost data for processing physical mail. Print out PDF forms to fill in and send in to scan

Observations

\- makes up a significant chunk of calls. Could take at face value and say its ripe for a chatbot. 

\- Potential for savings; on call volumes £300k. Less than 5% can be resolved by a call centre

\- Spoke to 2 call centre staff - not in business of resolving any cases, just triaging to contact in correct team

\- Lowers chatbot gain to £14.1k

Speculation/debate/specialist knowledge = not a good case

Is it right to bundle them together? very different services and user journeys captured under that with different teams

Customer data handled by systems other than the CRM

Different demographics across two council areas

Few website sessions compared to other services (esp waste) - suggests that people inclined to pick up the phone 

Some use cases in triaging, payments (depending on more robust integrations), more significant would be for updates via AI based SMS

## Next Steps

Next week is Sprint #3 looking at Revenues and Benefits services in Redditch & Bromsgrove, Preston and Adur & Worthing.
