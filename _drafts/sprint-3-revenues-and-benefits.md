## User research interviews

### Redditch and Bromsgrove

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted

### Preston

Ian Heslop

### Cheltenham

Claire Cook ran a third week of interviews at Cheltenham. 

## Stakeholder interviews

Tom Williams from Torchbox had been speaking to key stakeholders in each council, as well as using data gathered to date on contact centre activity and website analytics, to get an early view on opportunities to introduce automation in Revenues and Benefits services.

Learning points

Luiza, Kyle and Kristen worked on a retrospective after the user research interviews in North East Derbyshire to identify things for others to take away from the process

Things that made it good

Kristen took care of us and helped with all the set up and bringing people to - from the interview room

We spoke to 6 people - met our target

Water was provided - good for day long interviewing + to make interviewees comfortable

Phone set up for remote interviews was all done for us - good connection!

(Kristen) I got to listen in to Luiza and Kyle interviewing on day 1 and pick up some good tips. I think I would have felt quite lost to begin with, otherwise.

Things that made it bad

The out of town location meant we had to rely on transport - the taxi was late picking us up on day 2

(Kristen) Two users asked to change appointments at the last minute

One user shook my hand on the way in, even though he was quite ill and coughing everywhere

User who brought her 2 year old kid with her was slightly distracted during the interview (kid trying to escape the room (we had to build a blockade), having to change nappies mid session, kid eating the Sudocrem) - we got as much value as possible from the session but it was challenging

Not having lunch options on site / within walking distance

(Kristen) I found it difficult to keep to the timeslot with the first few people - it’s clearly a skill gained from experience to stop people from going off topic or ‘waffling’

Next Steps

Next week is Sprint #3 looking at Revenues and Benefits services in Redditch & Bromsgrove, Preston and Adur & Worthing.
