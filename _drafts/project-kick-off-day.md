It’s felt like an age in arriving, but finally the Chatbot project has launched properly. With contracts exchanged and our delivery partners engaged it was time to all get together in Birmingham for an all-day kick-off event.

The objectives of the event were to ensure that everyone had a common understanding of the project, what was required from all participants (and when) and how it would run.

Amazingly, this was the first time that (nearly) everyone involved in the project had met in person. Having said that, we had to use a conference phone to dial in two councils to get a full representation. Sometimes the phone worked too!

## Setting the scene

Neil Lawrence from Oxford City Council, leading the project gave an introduction to the journey taken to get to this event, starting with the Expressions of Interest stage back in September through the contract signing on 15 February.

It was a good opportunity to remind everyone what the project was looking to deliver and why, including the ethos behind the project - ‘giving something back’ to the sector to re-use. Key questions to be resolved are;

* Can we use chatbots and AI to solve service delivery problems?
* How do we focus on user needs?
* Is there a robust business case for using this technology?
* How do we get started?

It also focused on what members of the project team had said about how they wanted the project team to work together, what its culture would feel like, what individuals’ hopes and fears were and what user research was available already.

## Getting a set of common objectives

[Tom Williamson](https://torchbox.com/team/tom-williams/) from Torchbox led us all in a set of Post It exercises to help us all understand where we were each coming from as organisations and as a project.

We were asked to identify;

* Council objectives that could be applied to the project
* Objectives that each council had for the project as a whole
* Any metrics they’d use to measure success (or ‘magic numbers’)

After each exercise, everyone was allowed two votes to use on any of the Post-It’s that best captured what everyone felt

It was great to see where our thinking coincided and what we all felt was important.

Ensuring we captured the 'votes from Norway' (little Eurovision reference for you there) from our dial-in attendees was fun too!

## Research Aims

[Luiza Frederico](https://torchbox.com/team/luiza-frederico/) from Torchbox talked us through how the user research would be organised.

From our project objectives exercise it was clear that the councils involved all want to see great user research carried out, and also to gain skills in this area to use in future projects.

Torchbox will be enabling this through;

* Two training days (split geographically) to get all involved up to speed with good practice in user research. Each council will be able to send up to two attendees
* Carrying out the user research at one council site for each of the research areas.
* Producing materials to help guide other councils in carrying out their own research
