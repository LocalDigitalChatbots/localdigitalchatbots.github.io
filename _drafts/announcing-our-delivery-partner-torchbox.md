After making it through to the final five suppliers from the 44 applications received, Torchbox impressed the assessment panel with their submission. In particular;

* How they would meet the requirements and deliverables we set out
* the approach and methodology they would use, particularly in meeting the geographical challenge of a widely distributed team like ours
* the team they intended to use to carry out the work, and their level of expertise
* their experience in coaching and mentoring
* the way they planned the work to be undertaken and its timing
* their cultural fit with how we wanted to work as a team

Tom gave us an insight into the development of AI, and how larger platforms are making this easily accessible to organisations to get started quickly and at low costs. 

He told us how excited his team was about working on this project (apparently they are fighting over who gets to play).

## Meeting Barbra
