This week we completed sprint 1 of the project, looking at planning services across three councils. As well as user research interviews with 18 people there were stakeholder interviews with 6 staff in councils, and a stack of data gathering to get completed.

## Show and Tell

Friday saw us bring together initial findings from the week and a chance for all participating councils to get early headlines.

We had 10 people on the Hangout, including Andrew, one of the Planning team from Oxford, who was able to jump in and answer a question arising from the research.

Although we'd captured the event on video, our sound recording didn't work out, so instead the slides are presented below, and we go into a bit more detail about the work after that.

## User research interviews

> “It’s a very complex and nuanced and subjective topic of conversation, and not having an answer that fits all is an issue when it comes to giving specialised customer service”

\- (Luiza - got a similar sense of ‘can I just talk to someone that knows what they’re talking about’. ‘I’ve gone on the website but the FAQs are not specific enough for what I need - my problem is much more nuanced than the FAQs

### Hertsmere

John Robinson fed back on Hertsmere's three days of interviews.

Most of the people that responded to the user recruitment did so because they had an issue personal to them. It had to be explained to them that there was a fixed script and that their personal questions couldn't be addressed.

They found that people really wanted to speak to a planning officer rather than contact centre staff; it was hard for them to get through to the back office. With the website not providing answers to the questions they had it was more likely to generate calls;

> “I think here its frustrations of ‘I want to speak to a planning officer - I don’t want to speak to anyone else’ "

However, a key issue they shared with the other councils is  the number of available planning officers to take those direct calls;

> “Our underlying problem is recruiting and retaining planning officers - we just haven’t got enough”

John's interviews echoed the findings from Oxford; for people responding to someone else's application there was more on an emotional attachment to the process;

> “With objections it’s very emotive and they’re not necessarily going to get the answer they want anyway”

\- Issue with two people turning up - didn’t read instructions

\- FAQs not specific enough so want to speak to someone)

\- Agent: why can’t council give information on land they can develop? Different angle

\- Top tip; switch recording device on

## Data gathering

As Torchbox were doing the heavy lifting with user interviews in Oxford, Neil Lawrence had spent time digging further into available data to learn more. This included;

* Listening in to 100 calls to Planning dealt with by the Contact Centre
* Analysing 3 months of emails to the main Planning email address, with a deeper analysis on 90 web contact form submissions
* Looking at the volume of downloads from the website

This has been summarised on the [Oxford Data Dive page](/data-dive-planning-service-oxford-city-council/). Reactions by colleagues to the information this revealed had been interesting; it had been anticipated that a far higher proportion of calls would direct people to the website. Also, the volume of downloads 

> “Someone said ‘there’s such a large volume of downloads going on but they’re still calling us’ so it’s not hard from that to move to ’is the stuff we’re giving people on the web in any way meeting user needs”
