This week we completed sprint 1 of the project, looking at planning services across three councils. As well as user research interviews with 18 people there were stakeholder interviews with 6 staff within councils, and a stack of data gathering to get completed.

## Show and Tell

Friday saw us bring together initial findings from the week and a chance for all participating councils to get early headlines.

We had 10 people on the Hangout, including Andrew, one of the Planning team from Oxford, who was able to jump in and answer a question arising from the research. 

Although we'd captured the event on video, our sound recording didn't work out, so instead the slides are presented below, and we go into a bit more detail about the work after that.
