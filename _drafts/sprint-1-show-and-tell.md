This week we completed sprint 1 of the project, looking at planning services across three councils. As well as user research interviews with 18 people there were stakeholder interviews with 6 staff within councils, and a stack of data gathering to get completed.

## Show and Tell

Friday saw us bring together initial findings from the week and a chance for all participating councils to get early headlines.

We had 10 people on the Hangout, including Andrew, one of the Planning team from Oxford, who was able to jump in and answer a question arising from the research. 

Although we'd captured the event on video, our sound recording didn't work out, so instead the slides are presented below, and we go into a bit more detail about the work after that.

John Robinson fed back on Hertsmere's three days of interviews. 

Most of the people that responded to the user recruitment did so because they had an issue personal to them. They had to be 

People really wanted to speak to a planning officer and were frustrated at talking to contact centre; it was hard for them to get to the back office

> “I think here its frustrations of ‘I want to speak to a planning officer - I don’t want to speak to anyone else’ "

However, a key issue shared with the other councils is the the number of available planning officers to take those calls

\- Issue with two people turning up - didn’t read instructions

\- website doesn’t have the information they want, could reduce calls

\- (Luiza - got a similar sense of ‘can I just talk to someone that knows what they’re talking about’. ‘I’ve gone on the website but the FAQs are not specific enough for what I need - my problem is much more nuanced than the FAQs

\- FAQs not specific enough so want to speak to someone)

\- Objections are emotive, not going to get the answers they want

\- Agent: why can’t council give information on land they can develop? Different angle

\- Top tip; switch recording device on

“We found that most people that responded did so because they had a personal issue”

> “With objections it’s very emotive and they’re not necessarily going to get the answer they want anyway”

“Our underlying problem is recruiting and retaining planning officers - we just haven’t got enough”
