After initial preparations, week 3 of the project has seen things shift up a gear as we get ready for the first sprint.

## User research training

With 10 councils covering 4 areas of research it wasn't feasible for all the user research to be carried out by our delivery partner, Torchbox,

The project approach we've adopted is;

* The lead council for each research area to have user research undertaken by Torchbox
* Other councils participating in the research area to carry out their own user research using the same framework as Torchbox
* User research training provided to all councils by Torchbox to facilitate this, and also to up-skill all participating councils to become more self-sufficient in this area
