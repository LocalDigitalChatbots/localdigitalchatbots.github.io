After initial preparations, week 3 of the project has seen things shift up a gear as we get ready for our first sprint.

## User research approach

With 10 councils covering 4 areas of research it wasn't feasible for all the user research to be carried out by our delivery partner, Torchbox,

The project approach we've adopted is;

* The lead council for each research area to have user research undertaken by Torchbox
* Other councils participating in the research area to carry out their own user research using the same framework as Torchbox
* User research training provided to all councils by Torchbox to facilitate this, and also to up-skill all participating councils to become more self-sufficient in this area

## Training and materials

With participating councils spread out across the country we decided on two training days to cover everyone;

* Doncaster - 1 March (attended by Doncaster, Rotherham, Cheltenham, North East Derbyshire and Preston)
* Oxford - 7 March (attended by Hertsmere, Redditch & Bromsgrove, Surrey and Oxford)

These training days were led by Luiza Frederico of Torchbox

The [materials developed for the project](project-resources/) were designed for use by Torchbox in their research interviews, and  councils undertaking their own research to provide a consistent approach and ensure that the analysis and synthesis of the results for a research area can be more easily combined.

In addition, these have been designed for any council

They include

* A [user recruitment guide](/uploads/Chatbots_ User recruitment guide.pdf "Chatbots_ User recruitment guide.pdf") for research interviews
* A [user research script]() for conducting interviews
* A [consent form](https://github.com/LocalDigitalChatbots/localdigitalchatbots.github.io/blob/master/resources/user_research/consent_form.md) to use with users being interviewed
* [Data capture templates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yR_3IzpGriXMr1Qf6AEuhGZDl9lK7tNbLQgC-5-CvE/edit?usp=sharing) to assist in capturing what is important and displaying the user experience

The training itself started with a reminder of why it is important to focus on what user needs are rather than rush to identify what solutions will work.
