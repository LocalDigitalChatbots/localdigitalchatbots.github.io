## User research approach

With 10 councils covering 4 areas of research it wasn't feasible for all the user research to be carried out by our delivery partner, Torchbox,

The project approach we've adopted is;

* The lead council for each research area to have user research undertaken by Torchbox
* Other councils participating in the research area to carry out their own user research using the same framework as Torchbox
* User research training provided to all councils by Torchbox to facilitate this, and also to up-skill all participating councils to become more self-sufficient in this area

## Training and materials

With participating councils spread out across the country we decided on two training days to cover everyone;

* Doncaster - 1 March (attended by Doncaster, Rotherham, Cheltenham, North East Derbyshire and Preston)
* Oxford - 7 March (attended by Hertsmere, Redditch & Bromsgrove, Surrey and Oxford)

These training days were led by Luiza Frederico of Torchbox
