This week we completed Sprint #4 of the project, looking at Highways services in Surrey (as our only highways authority. As well as user research interviews with 8 members of the public there were stakeholder interviews with 2 staff in the council.

## User research interviews

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted.

### Experience maps

The two user journeys created for the process were

* reporting an issue or requesting an improvement
* complex urban planning enquiries

## Stakeholder interviews

Tom Williams from Torchbox had been speaking to key stakeholders in Surrey , as well as using data gathered to date on contact centre activity and website analytics, to get an early view on opportunities to introduce automation in Highways services.

There was some excellent data available on the breakdown of calls

Observations on the data that could be made were;

* The variety of reasons for calling about highways was in stark comparison to the of Waste & Recycling, where 80% of calls could be swept up under 3 main types. For highways, the largest single reason for calling was potholes at just 7.7%

* Revenues and Benefits makes up a significant chunk of calls.  At face value this suggests it is well suited for a chatbot solution

* On call volumes alone a saving of £300k could be estimated. However less than 5% were resolved by a call centre, which lowers potential chatbot gain to £14.1k

* There were few website sessions for this service compared to other services (particularly waste) which suggests that people are more inclined to phone
* There are some use cases in triaging calls and payments (which would require more robust integrations). More feasible solutions may include user updates via AI-based SMS

A key question arising from analyzing revenues and benefits as a service is "is it right to bundle them together?" They are very different services and with different user journeys captured under that involving different teams.

## Next Steps

Next week is Sprint #3 looking at Revenues and Benefits services in Redditch & Bromsgrove, Preston and Adur & Worthing.
