This week we completed Sprint #4 of the project, looking at Highways services in Surrey (as our only highways authority. As well as user research interviews with 8 members of the public there were stakeholder interviews with 2 staff in the council.

## User research interviews

Luiza from Torchbox fed back on the interviews that she and Kyle had conducted.

### Experience maps

The two user journeys created for the process were

* reporting an issue or requesting an improvement
* complex urban planning enquiries

## Stakeholder interviews

Tom Williams from Torchbox had been speaking to key stakeholders in Surrey , as well as using data gathered to date on contact centre activity and website analytics, to get an early view on opportunities to introduce automation in Highways services.

There was some excellent data available on the breakdown of calls

Observations on the data that could be made were;

* The variety of reasons for calling about highways was in stark comparison to the of Waste & Recycling, where 80% of calls could be swept up under 3 main types. For highways, the largest single reason for calling was potholes at just 7.7%

* Surrey had already migrated a large amount of contact (%) to the web
* On call volumes alone a saving of £106k could be estimated. But with 64% being resolved by the contact centre, the potential chatbot gain is lowered to £68.3k

## Next Steps

This week saw the completion of the user research and data gathering phase, with the project now moving into its final stage of distilling and compiling all the information obtained for the final project outputs.

These will all be published on this project site by 23 April 2019.
