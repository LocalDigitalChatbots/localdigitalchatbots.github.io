We've just finished 3 days of Agile for Teams training with the [GDS Academy]() in London. For the nine of us attending, the journey distances varied quite a bit (as did the quality of the hotels we stayed at, apparently).

For anyone in doubt, having your team in one place learning the same things together is a fantastic way to get to know each other and apply the learning to the practical aspects of your project.

This training was set up for us by the Local Digital Collaboration Unit as part of our funded project status. We also had our excellent project lead, [Adam Thoulass](https://twitter.com/AdamThoulass), sitting in to provide wise counsel.

## What we covered

The course did a great job of covering the essentials of Agile, including;

* Agile culture
* The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) and its principles
* Creating user stories and the 3Cs
* Scrum theory, including an obligatory Lego exercise
* Scrum roles and ceremonies
* Story mapping
* Designing for accessibility
* Servant leadership
* Agile estimating
* Backlog refinement
* Kanban and Scrumban
