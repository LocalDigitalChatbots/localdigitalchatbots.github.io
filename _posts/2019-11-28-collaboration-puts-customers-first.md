You may be familiar with our [online services](https://environment.rushmoor.gov.uk/) that allow customers to manage their garden waste, report a missed bin, have bulky waste items collected from their homes and recycle their Christmas trees - particularly if you live in Rushmoor. These are great services that have had great feedback, and the back-story is really worth sharing.
 
It began in October 2018, when Serco, which delivers our environmental services, found itself unable to provide a customer portal . Our response? Not a problem, we will develop this ourselves! A cross-cutting team came together, drawing on the experience of colleagues from Operations, Customer Experience, ICT and Communications and within just a couple of months, the first phase was launched, enabling customers to book online to recycle their Christmas trees.
 
Using customer feedback from this first phase, the team built on their experiences and lessons learned to roll out more phases, with the final product completed just a year later in October 2019. And the response? Already, up to 50% of  bookings are now made through our website, freeing up time for our Customer Services colleagues to spend delivering other services, with our customers saying ‘brilliant’, ‘straight to the point’, ‘ I think it’s perfect!’
 
Fantastic outcome, and we are proud of everyone who committed their time and energy to make this a success.
