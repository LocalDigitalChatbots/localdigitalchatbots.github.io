The [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#tenth) has revolutionised the way people access government services. Their principle of working openly has been key to their success. As we set out on our own digital revolution, we want to follow in their footsteps. 

By being open, we can find people to work with that we would never have connected with any other way. We also encourage others to be open with us. Plus, our residents will be able to understand and contribute to what we are doing and why we’re doing it. 

We’ll be able to get stuff done, quickly, by reusing the ideas of others and letting others critique what we’re doing. It will mean we can build support for what we do and use that momentum to keep improving things. 

This openness isn’t to replace official news or the work of our elected councillors. Instead, we want to give people a different insight into our daily work and how we’re trying to make things better. We’ll be trying to stick to a few rules as we start blogging: 

* No policy or political announcements 
* Blog, talk and act by our values 
* Ask someone before mentioning them or their work 
* Speak plainly in an informal style 

We’ll blog about: 
* Personal reflections on our own work, what we’re doing, how we’re doing it and what we’re learning on the way 
* Our ideas, intentions, successes, failures 
* Things published by others that we think are particularly interesting or inspiring. 

Finally, we hope those who read our blogs might consider joining the team and work with us.
