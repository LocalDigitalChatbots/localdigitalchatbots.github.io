Yesterday we published a Digital Outcomes and Specialists opportunity to find the perfect Digital Agency to work with us on this project. [You can read it here](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/8531 "Digital Marketplace Opportunity").

It's been a challenging process, crunching down all the ambitions and deliverables of the project into succinct 100 or 200 paragraphs. But the objective of the Digital Opportunities framework is to enable the market to find solutions to problems rather than spell out how it should be delivered.

For this project, we're hoping this process will bring us a range of potential suppliers and solutions to work through so we can find the best fit for us. As ever with this project, time is tight, and Christmas holidays could impact on responses.
