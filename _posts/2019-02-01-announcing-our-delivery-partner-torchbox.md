We're more than a little excited to announce our delivery partner for the project: [Torchbox](https://torchbox.com/about/ "Torchbox")![Torchbox logo](/uploads/torchbox.jpg "Torchbox Ltd")

After making it through to the final five suppliers from the 44 applications received, Torchbox impressed the assessment panel with their proposal submission. In particular;

* how they would meet the requirements and deliverables we set out
* the approach and methodology they would use, particularly in meeting the geographical challenge of a widely distributed team like ours
* the team they intended to use to carry out the work, and their level of expertise
* their experience in coaching and mentoring teams
* the phasing of the work to be undertaken and its timing
* their cultural fit with how we wanted to work as a team

## Meeting Tom

Those of us who attended the [Agile for Teams training](https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/agile/training/2019/01/30/getting-agile/) were lucky enough to meet Torchbox Technical Director, Tom Dyson, who dropped in to get to know us ahead of the project kicking off properly.

Tom gave us an insight into the development of AI, and how larger platforms are making this easily accessible to organisations to get started quickly and at low costs.

He told us how excited his team was about working on this project ;

> We're delighted to be partnering with the 13 councils participating in this very exciting project - everyone at Torchbox is clamouring to be involved! 
>
> Chatbots and AI are glamorous topics in the IT world, but
>
> our teams of researchers and technologists are committed to seeking practical solutions to help local authorities improve the lives of their residents in sensible, cost-effective ways.
